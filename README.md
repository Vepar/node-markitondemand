Node.js library for accessing the **[Markit On Demand](http://dev.markitondemand.com)** APIs . Markit On Demand 'offers an opportunity to explore the complexity of financial data in building great tools'. The library gives you the ability to lookup stock symbols and and get stock quotes. 

### Getting Started

To install the npm package:

```bash
    $ npm install node-markitondemand --save
```

### Using the Library

There are three APIs available to use:

* lookup()
* getStock()
* getQuote()
* getQuotes()

#### lookup()

lookup(symbol, callback(stock));

Used to search stocks.

```javascript
   var markit = require('node-markitondemand');

   markit.lookup('AAPL', function(data) {
     // Where data is an array of stock symbols
     console.log(data);
   });
```
#### getStock()

getStock is an alias of lookup()

Used to search stocks.

#### getQuote()

getQuote(symbol, callback(stock));

Used to get latest stock data.

```javascript
   var markit = require('node-markitondemand');

   markit.getQuote('AAPL', function(stock) {
     // Where stock is an object of stock data
     console.log(stock);
   });
```
#### getQuotes()

getQuotes(symbols, callback(stock));

Used to get latest stock data for multiple symbols.

**Warning:** __Using this function is not recommended. You may get throttled on excessive requests to the API.__

```javascript
   var markit = require('node-markitondemand');

   markit.getQuote(['AAPL', 'F'], function(stocks) {
     // Where stocks is an array of objects of stock data
     console.log(stocks);
   });
```

### Running Tests
